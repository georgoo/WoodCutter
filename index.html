      <h1>
        To those~ who dream of a fulfilled life .
      </h1>
      <p>
        It recently occurred to me... 
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone is familiar with the story of the
        woodcutter whose axe fell into the river. A goddess appeared with three
        axes—a golden axe, a silver axe, and an iron axe—and gave him all three
        as a reward for choosing the right one.
      </p>
      <p>
        When asked about the moral of this story, most people say it’s about
        honesty. But there’s more to it. It’s also about the axes—the choices we
        make.
      </p>
      <p>
        As children, we naturally gravitate towards certain activities, things
        we love to do simply because they make us happy. We follow our instincts
        and pursue these passions without hesitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as we grow older, things change. We try to fit in, bowing to peer
        pressure and societal expectations. We chase wealth, recognition, and
        success. In this pursuit, we either lose sight of our passion or ignore
        it altogether for so many reasons—fear, doubt, or practicality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, like the axe that sank to the bottom of the river, our passion
        remains within us, hidden in the depths of our being.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the goddess presented the woodcutter with the three axes, he chose
        the right one because he remembered his own axe. He had not forgotten
        what it looked like because it was etched in his memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, life offers us choices—different "axes." The iron axe
        represents our passion, the silver axe represents fame, and the golden
        axe represents wealth. If we choose the right one—our passion—we often
        gain the others as well, just as the goddess gifted all three axes to
        the woodcutter.
      </p>
      <p>
        But for this to happen, we need a memory as clear as the woodcutter’s to
        recognize our true axe from our past, the one we’ve always had deep
        inside. And most importantly, we must be honest with ourselves when it
        comes to choosing.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you feel lost or unsure of your passion, pause and look back at your
        life. What were the things you loved? What are the quiet joys that have
        followed you over the years?
